    "### Background\n",
    "The SIR model (developed by W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick in 1927) is one of the simplest variants in a group of [compartmental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) used in theoretical biology to model how an infectious disease spreads in a population in order to determine the likely outcome of an epidemic. The variables S, I and R represent the number of people in the compartments of the population and the differential equations describe the transition rates and thus flow between the compartments over time. When based on ODEs, the models are deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic reproduction number $R$ is given by $R=c/w$. It describes the expected number of new infections caused by one infected individual (in a population where all subjects are susceptible).\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complex model based on SEIR and including deaths and hospitalization with an interactive interface can be found [here](https://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html). In addition to more compartments, one can also consider spatial dependencies in addition to time."
