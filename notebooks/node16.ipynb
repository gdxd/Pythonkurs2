    "History:\n",
    "* In early computers, a program would run from start to finish before the next program started $\\Rightarrow$ <font color=#008000> *Batch–Processing*</font>\n",
    "* More modern operating systems support <font color=#008000> *Multi-Tasking*</font> , i.e. the CPU time is distributed to the various processes via a time-sharing mechanism. On single-CPU computers, of course, only one process is running at a time, but typically after a few milliseconds, the next one is $\\Rightarrow$ Basis for <font color=#008000> *interactive multi-user systems*</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the individual processes run completely separately, each program has its own memory area, its own variables, etc.\n",
    "* <font color=#008000> *Multi–Processing:*</font> Programs run in parallel, but still independently (as independent processes), i.e. no shared memory area. Explicit tools needed for communication. Can also be distributed over several/many computing nodes.\n",
    "* <font color=#008000> *Multi–Threading*</font> goes beyond that. Several versions of <font color=#008000> *a*</font> program run “simultaneously” on a computing node, all of which access the <font color=#008000> *same*</font> memory area.\n",

    "* Instead, introduction of <font color=#0000ff> **Multi-Core**</font> CPUs, i.e. multiple processor cores on one chip. Currently 2-4 cores are already common in smartphones and laptops, 8 cores in desktop systems and 16-80 cores in servers, the trend towards more cores continues.\n",
