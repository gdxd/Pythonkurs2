This allows easy further processing. A practical example from our area is the SGE batch system on the LRZ Linux cluster. The batch system manages \"jobs\" on a computer cluster and provides information on the status of the running jobs such as job ID, CPU time used, start time, memory requirement, and much more. This information is important for users, but also for monitoring systems around the Monitor cluster utilization. An example output includes the xml file [SGE-qstat.xml](http://www-static.etp.physik.uni-muenchen.de/kurs/Computing/python2/source/SGE-qstat.xml), and a simple SAX parser is [SGE-qstat.xml](http://www-static.etp.physik.uni-muenchen.de/kurs/Computing/python2/source/SGE-qstat.xml).\n", "* Find job-id, user-name, start time and consumed cpu time of jobs\n", "* The important monitoring variable is the comparison of the CPU time used to the elapsed wall clock time.

The \"tracks\" are often recorded in the so-called \"gpx\" format, which is defined in XML and allows easy exchange of the recorded tracks or further processing of the data. An example track from MTB Tour in the Alps contains the file [GPS_example.gpx](http://www-static.etp.physik.uni-muenchen.de/kurs/Computing/python2/source/GPS_example.gpx), with information about position, date/time, altitude and heart rate.
